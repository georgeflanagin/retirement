A retirement calculator

There are many calculators. I have been increasing my familiarity 
with datetime and dateutil.

This calculator uses argparse to let you change its operation.

```
usage: retirement.py [-h] --birthday BIRTHDAY --hiredate HIREDATE
                     [--min-age MIN_AGE] [--req-years REQ_YEARS]
                     [--magic-number MAGIC_NUMBER]
```
